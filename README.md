# Fuzzer Development With Rust (Basic)

##### Each researcher needs to be able to develop their own fuzzing tools. For this reason, I have started teaching how to develop fuzzing tools from scratch in this project so that researchers can use their own fuzzer to discover security vulnerabilities of open source tools, libraries and code that companies develop internally.
##### In this training, we have explained all the concepts along with examples in the rust programming language so that the desired concepts can be understood correctly.
